# Crypto Arbitrage Monitor

A real-time monitoring tool for identifying cryptocurrency arbitrage opportunities across multiple exchanges.

## Overview

Crypto Arbitrage Monitor helps traders identify and capitalize on price differences between cryptocurrency exchanges. By continuously monitoring multiple exchanges in real-time, it detects price discrepancies that could potentially be profitable for arbitrage trading.

### What is Crypto Arbitrage?

Crypto arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of price differences between cryptocurrency exchanges. For example, if Bitcoin is trading at $50,000 on Exchange A and $50,200 on Exchange B, a trader could potentially profit from this $200 difference (minus fees) by buying on Exchange A and selling on Exchange B.

### Key Features

- Real-time price monitoring across multiple exchanges
- Configurable price difference thresholds
- Support for multiple cryptocurrency pairs
- Automated alerts for arbitrage opportunities
- Low-latency websocket connections
- Customizable exchange API integration

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the monitor, ensure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Access to cryptocurrency exchange API keys
- Stable internet connection with good latency

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trendcryptobots/Crypto-Arbitrage-Monitor.git
cd Crypto-Arbitrage-Monitor
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Copy the example configuration file:
```bash
cp config.example.py config.py
```

## Configuration

### Exchange API Setup

1. Create API keys on your preferred exchanges
2. Edit `config.py` with your API credentials:
```python
EXCHANGE_APIS = {
    "binance": {
        "api_key": "your_api_key",
        "api_secret": "your_api_secret"
    },
    # Add more exchanges as needed
}
```

### Monitor Settings

Configure monitoring parameters in `config.py`:
```python
SETTINGS = {
    "min_profit_threshold": 0.5,  # Minimum price difference (%)
    "trading_pairs": ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"],  # Pairs to monitor
    "update_interval": 1,  # Update frequency in seconds
    "exchanges": ["binance", "kucoin", "huobi"]  # Exchanges to monitor
}
```

## Usage

1. Start the monitor:
```bash
python monitor.py
```

2. Monitor output will display:
- Current prices across exchanges
- Potential arbitrage opportunities
- Profit percentages and absolute differences
- Trading volume and liquidity information

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never commit your API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Set appropriate API key permissions (read-only if not trading)

### Performance
- Adjust update intervals based on your network latency
- Monitor system resource usage
- Consider running on a server close to exchange APIs
- Use separate instances for different trading pairs

### Risk Management
- Start with small test trades
- Account for exchange fees in profit calculations
- Consider withdrawal fees and limits
- Monitor exchange liquidity and volume

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Connection Errors
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check API key permissions
   - Ensure exchange APIs are accessible

2. High Latency
   - Reduce number of monitored pairs
   - Increase update interval
   - Check network performance

3. Missing Opportunities
   - Adjust profit thresholds
   - Verify exchange fee calculations
   - Check for sufficient trading volume
